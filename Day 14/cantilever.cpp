/*
Problem Statement : According to the regulations of Cantileverâ€™s army, a reconnaissance unit should consist of exactly two soldiers. Since these two soldiers should n't differ much, their heights can differ by at most d centimetres.
Captain Bob has n soldiers in his detachment. Their heights are a1, a2, ...,an centimeters. Some soldiers are of the same height. Bob wants to know, how many ways exist to form a reconnaissance unit of two soldiers from his detachment.
Ways (1,2) and (2,1) should be regarded as different.

Input
Input Format
The first line contains the number of testcases, t
For each testcase:
The first line contains the integers, n and d
The second line contains the height of the soldiers
Constraints
1<=t<=10
1<=n<=100
1<=d<=10000
1<=height=10000

Output:-

Print the total number of ways to form a reconnaissance unit of two soldiers from his detachment.
